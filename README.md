# ResturauntApp

I followed along with the Guided Project: Restaurant from the App Development with Swift Textbook.

I learned some new Swift tools and learned how to send and retrieve information using a web service API. I designed an interactive menu for a restaurant that allows the customer to view a list of offerings, add items to an order, and submit the order to the restaurant. I used a server downloaded from the books instructions to modify the options, descriptions, and images that are returned from the API.
